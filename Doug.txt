I like your dog. Is it a Golden Retriever?
Yes it is. Actually I was about to go on a walk with my dog.


Hi! how are you. I am in a bit of a pinch. could you spot me 10 dollars?
Who do you take me for? I am not the bank of Paris? Sorry you will have to find your money elsewhere.


Hello! what time is it?

It is mine here is my room ticket. See! could you give me my key!
Okay... but I require a finder's reward... 50 dollars should suffice.
